    <h1>Why the Pacers suck this year</h1>
    <h3>And how do we fix this?</h3>
    <p>The Pacers on paper have one of the better offensive ratings when all palyers are healthy.
        Alas, our season this year has been anything but that. While it is much easier to judge 
        from the comfort of our homes, I have devised a list of what <b>my</b> solutions would be. </p>
    <br />
    <h3>List to fix our broken Pacers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><s>Fire our old head coach</s></li>
        <li>Keep player from getting fatigued before the forth quarter</li>
        <li>If someone is on a cold streak, remove them and let fresh legs take over</li>
        <li>Keep the ball moving at all costs</li>
        <li>No matter how big the lead, always play like you're losing</li>
    </ol>
